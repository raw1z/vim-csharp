INTRODUCTION                                    *csharp*

This plugin offers various useful tools for c# development:
  
  - Compilation
  - Debugging
  - Online doc

I borrowed many idea from this blog:

Note: This plugin depends on the following vim plugins:

  - vim-dispatch: https://github.com/tpope/vim-dispatch.git
